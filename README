Holide is an HOL to Dedukti translator. It accepts files in the OpenTheory
standard proof format and produces files for the Dedukti proof checker.

The source code is available online at:
https://gforge.inria.fr/projects/holide/

You need OCaml to compile it. It was tested with OCaml 3.12.0, but previous
versions should work just as well. To compile, simply run 'make' in the main
directory.

Usage: holide <options> <file>

  --just-check   Just check, do not translate
  -o <file>      Set output filename
  --quiet        Suppress all information
  --untyped-def  Use untyped declarations
  --version      Print version and exit
  -help          Display this list of options
  --help         Display this list of options

Example:

  ./holide dedukti opentheory/bool.art -o dedukti/bool.dk

This produces a file named 'dedukti/bool.dk' which is an encoding of the theory
of the file 'opentheory/bool.art'. All generated files depend on the main HOL
logic, which is formalized in the file 'dedukti/hol.dk'

There are many ways to obtain proofs in the OpenTheory format. If you have
the opentheory tool installed, you can automatically export and translate the
theories of the OpenTheory standard library using the commands
'make packages' and 'make atomic'.
