Holide is an HOL to Dedukti translator. It accepts files in the OpenTheory
standard proof format and produces files for the Dedukti proof backend.

The source code is available online at:
https://scm.gforge.inria.fr/svn/acs/trunk/holide/

You need OCaml to compile it. It was tested with OCaml 3.12.0, but previous
versions should work just as well. To compile, simply run 'make' in the main
directory. It will produce an executable named 'holide'.

Usage: ./holide <options> <file>
  --dict    Use opentheory dictionary compression
  --mangle  Activate name mangling for variable names
  -o <file> Set output filename
  --steps   Output intermediary derivation steps
  -help     Display this list of options
  --help    Display this list of options

It is strongly recommended to use the --steps option to produce files of
manageable size. It greatly reduces the size of the output. If you don't want
to use this option, at least use --dict to make use the OpenTheory dictionary
sharing.

Example:

  ./holide --steps dedukti opentheory/bool.art -o dedukti/bool.dk

This produces a file named 'dedukti/bool.dk' which is an encoding of the theory
of the file 'opentheory/bool.art'. All generated files depend on the main HOL
logic, which is formalized in the file 'dedukti/hol.dk'

There are many ways to obtain proofs in the OpenTheory format. If you have
the opentheory tool installed, you can automatically export and translate the
theories of the OpenTheory standard library using the commands 'make base',
'make packages', and 'make atomic'.
